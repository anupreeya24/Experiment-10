# Experiment-10
**Aim:** <br>
To study and implement Pointer Operations (call by value and call by reference) <br>
<br>
**Theory:** <br>
There are two ways to call a variable to a function for various operations. <br>
| Call by Value  | Call by Reference |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| A method of passing arguments to a function where the actual value is passed.  | A method of passing arguments where the address of the variable is passed.  |
| Does not affect the original variable.  | Does affect the original variable.  |
| More memory is used because a copy of the actual value is made.  | Less memory is used because only the address is passed.  |
| Used when the function does not need to modify the original data.  | Used when the function needs to modify the original data or when passing large objects.  |
